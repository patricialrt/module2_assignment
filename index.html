      This chicken is the best chicken you ever had! It's after the secret recipy of my grandmom and super delicious. The chicken was happy, it had a good life in the best chicken conditions, with lots of space in a beautiful garden, many chicken friends and good, healthy food.

          Beef
    </h2>
    <p>
      This dish will make you addictive, you will dream of it and have cravings for it. The meat is comingfrom a happy farm which is 100% organic and eco-sustainable. This time the recipy comes from my father. He's often around in the restaurant and loves to exchange about slow food.

          Sushi

    <p>
      All of our fish has either the MSC label or it is from a responsible farmed aquaculture operation. So you can enjoy this delicious sushi without any regret. Zen moments while watching our japanese chef preparing the sushi are included in the price.
